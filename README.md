This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## HOW TO RUN

Run 'yarn install' inside project folder to install the dependencies.<br>
Then run 'yarn start' to start the React app.<br><br>
This project includes dummy data generated via http://mockaroo.com and uses superagent to fetch data from this fake API<br>
To run the app with the dummy data, first install the 'json-server' module globally ('npm install -g json-server')<br>  
Then start the dummy API by running 'json-server --port 4000 data.json' in the project root folder.<br>
This will run the server locally on your computer on http://localhost:4000, with dummy data and routes generated from the data.json file.
