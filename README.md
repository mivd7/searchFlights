This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run 'yarn start' to start the React app.<br>
This project includes dummy data generated by Mockaroo.com. To host your own dummy webserver, 
install json-server globally('npm install -g json-server).<br>
Then start the dummy API by running 'json-server --port 4000 data.json' inside the 'src' folder.<br>
This will run the server locally on http://localhost:4000, with dummy data generated from the data.json file.
